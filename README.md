# SportsTV

We want to watch a live NBA/Champions League game. We open up the subreddit page, scroll to find the one we want, click on a series of links to open up a page that will play the video. But, what awaits us is a series of pop-up ads. This experience is the worst on a PS4 where it's even harder to close the pop-up ads. What if there is a place where we can watch the sports game we want in just one click?
